 * These applications are used in the WiFi Distance Test experiment,
 * described and implemented in test02.cc.  That file should be in the
 * same place as this file.  The applications have two very simple
 * jobs, they just generate and receive packets.  We could use the
 * standard Application classes included in the NS-3 distribution.
 * These have been written just to change the behavior a little, and
 * provide more examples.
